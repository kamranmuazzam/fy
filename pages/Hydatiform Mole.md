	- Multiple pregnancy
- Complication
	- Immedaite
		- Hemorrhage and shock
		- Sepsis
		- Perforation of the uterus
		- Pre-eclampsia
		- Acute pulmonary insufficiency due to embolization
		- Coagulation failure
	- Late
		- Choriocarcinoma
- Management
	- Suction Evacualtion (SE)
		- If negative suction as fluid filled vesicles, hence expulsion easily by suction
	- Evaculation & Curettage
		- Disadvantage : If there is solid, there is risk of perforation
- Principles in the management
	- SE

	- Counseling for regular follow up
		- Advice
			- avoid pregnancy / barrier method or OCP
				- Reason : BHCG cannot be differentiated from remnant of molar pregnancy or due to new pregnancy
		- Follow up
			- Choriocarcinoma progression
				- beta HCG
					- Every week until 3 consecutive negative BHCG (within 6-8 weeks)
					- Monthly, for next 6 months
					- 3 Monthly, for next 6 months
