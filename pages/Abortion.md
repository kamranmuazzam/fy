  collapsed:: true
	- ((662a83f6-74f2-4375-9fc1-0f74339490fc))
	- ### 50% Genetic
		- 50% of such genetic abnormalities are trisomy
			- 30% of such trisomy is trisomy 16
		- 22% Polyploidy
		- 20% Monosomy X
			- ((662a8735-5c5f-462a-b3d2-54debdb99008))
		- 4% Others : translocations, deletions, inversions
	- ### 10-15% Endocrine
		- #### Leutal Phase Defect
			- Deficient Progesterone leads to defective implantation/placentation
		- #### Thyroid Abnormalities
			- Both [[Hypothyroidism]] and [[Hyperthyroidism]]
		- #### Diabetes mellitus
			- Poorly controlled/uncontrolled
	- ### 3-38% Anatomical Abnormalities
		- Cervical Incompetence
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Congenital malformations of uterus
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Bicornuate uterus
			- Septate uterus
			- Unicornuate uterus
			- #### Causes of Fetal Loss
				- Reduced Intrauterine Volume
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Reduced Expansile Property of Uterus
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Reduced Placental Vascularity when implanted on the septum
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Increased uterine irritability and contractility
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Uterine fibroids
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- It depends Size & Location of fibroid
				- Most common cause is submucous type
				- Bigger fibroid is more likely to cause abortion
		- Intrauterine adhesions (Synechiae)
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- [[Ashermen Syndrome]]

	- ### Infections
		- Viral : Rubella, CMV, Variola
		- Parasitic : Toxoplasma, Malaria
		- Bacterial : Ureaplasma, Chlamydia
	- ### Autoimmunity
		- Autimmune : ANA, ANTI-DNA, APLA - LAC, aCL
			- Placental thrombosis, Infarction & Fetal Hypoxia
			- Depending on the severity of fetal hypoxia we might have
				- IUGR
				- Abortion
				- Pregnancy Induced hypertension
				- Abrupto placentae
		- Alloimmune : Paternal antigens
		- Inherited Thrombophilias :  Protein C resistance (Commonest)
	- ### Miscellaneous
		- Maternal medical illness
			- Cyanotic heart disease
			- haemoglobinopathies
		- Blood group incompatibility
		- PROM
		- Environmental: smoking, alcohol
		- Sperm chromosomal Abnormalities
		- Unexplained
	- #### Etiology According to Trimester
		- 1st Trimester
			- Genetic
			- Endocrine
			- Trauma
