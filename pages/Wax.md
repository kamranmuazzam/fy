definition:: It is composed of desquamated epithelium, dirt, secretions of sebaceous (watery secretion) and seruminous gland (fatty secretion)

- ## Composition
	- Desquamated Epithelium
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Dirt
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Secretion of
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Sebaceous gland
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Serimunous gland
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- ## Excretion of Wax
	- By movement of jaw during eating, talking, chewing, etc
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Expelled in flakes but in certain individuals & children the wax accumulates -> external canal obstruction
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- ## Consistency
	- Soft -> if secretion increased
	- Hard -> if secretion decreased
- ## Function of normal wax
	- Lubrication
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Antibacterial (Bacteriostatic & Fungistatic -> due to acidic pH)
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Protection of ear from insect (foreign material) & dust

- ## Etiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Causative Agents
		- Long standing impacted wax may ulcerate the meatal skin & result in granuloma formation (*wax granuloma*)
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Excessive formation (hyper-secretion of gland)
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Excessive desquamation of canal wall
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- ### Risk Factors
		- Narrowing of external auditory canal
		- Hairy external ear
		- Frequent use of cotton bud - it hampers the normal cleaning
		- Hot Humid climate

	- ### Medical Treatment : no medical treatment
	  background-color:: red
	- ### Surgical Options
		- ## Treatment
			- If wax is soft : Aural toileting by micro suction, Jobson's Horne Probe
				- If children : GA + antibiotic
			- If wax is hard: Making it soft by 7.5% $$\ce{NaHCO3}$$ (or olive oil or coconut oil) 3-4 drops twice daily 5-7 days. Then micro suction is given
