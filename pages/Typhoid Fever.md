	- ### Expected Course
		- #### With Treatment
			- short-term febrile illness requiring a median of 6 days of hospitalization.
		- #### Without Treatment
			- illness of several weeks' duration with long-term morbidity often involving the central nervous system
			- **Onset and Initial Symptoms:**
				- The peaks and troughs of fever rise progressively in stepwise fashion.
				- Gastrointestinal symptoms include:
					- Diffuse abdominal pain and tenderness.
					- Colicky right upper quadrant pain.
					- Significant constipation due to inflamed Peyer patches.
			- **First Week of Illness:**
				- Development of:
					- Dry cough.
					- Dull frontal headache.
					- Delirium.
					- Severe malaise with marked stupor.
			- **Seven to Ten Days into Illness:**
				- Fever plateaus at 103-104°F (39-40°C).
				- Appearance of Rose Spots:
					- Salmon-colored, blanching, truncal, maculopapules.
					- 1-4 cm wide, fewer than 5 in number.
					- Resolve within 2-5 days.
				- Rose Spots caused by bacterial emboli to the dermis.
			- **Second Week of Illness:**
				- Progression of initial signs and symptoms.
				- Abdominal distension.
				- Soft splenomegaly.
				- Development of relative bradycardia and dicrotic pulse.
			- **Third Week of Illness:**
				- Patient becomes more toxic and anorexic with significant weight loss.
				- Infected conjunctivae.
				- Tachypnea with a thready pulse.
				- Crackles over lung bases.
				- Severe abdominal distension.
				- Possible "pea soup" diarrhea (foul, green-yellow, liquid).
				- Development of the typhoid state:
					- Apathy.
					- Confusion.
					- Psychosis.
				- Risk of necrotic Peyer patches leading to bowel perforation and peritonitis.
				- Potential death from overwhelming toxemia, myocarditis, or intestinal hemorrhage.
			- **Fourth Week of Illness (If Survives):**
				- Gradual improvement in fever, mental state, and abdominal distension.
				- Risk of intestinal and neurologic complications.
				- Prolonged weight loss and debilitating weakness.
				- Some survivors may become asymptomatic carriers of S. typhi, with potential for indefinite transmission.
	- ### Survival Rates
		- #### With Treatment
			- 0.2% risk of mortality
		- #### Without Treatment
			- 9%-13% risk of mortality
